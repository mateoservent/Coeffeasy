# Coeffeasy
`Coeffeasy` is an R package for making regression coefficients more accessible. With this tool, you can read linear and logistic coefficients accurately and instantly, and more things are coming!

In the evolving landscape of statistical tools within the R environment, `Coeffeasy` is an innovative R package designed to simplify and automate the interpretation of regression coefficients. Historically, statistics-related practitioners often sought expertise from specialists to navigate the intricacies of regression results, recognizing that although an interpretation of coefficients should follow a consistent design, the underlying knowledge to read the results of a regression can be quite technical and unambiguous in its presentation. Recognizing this challenge, `Coeffeasy` offers a systematic solution, primarily serving linear and logistic models. However, its developmental trajectory is set to incorporate advanced models such as Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Time Series data, and Experimental calculations like difference in means. A standout feature is its multilingual output capability, ensuring that the fundamental principles of statistical interpretation are comprehensible to a diverse, global user base. As data-driven decision-making continues to gain prominence, `Coeffeasy` aims to bridge the knowledge gap, providing clear and accessible statistical insights, reinforcing the importance of both automation and accessibility in contemporary data science.
