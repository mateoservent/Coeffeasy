# Coeffeasy
Coeffeasy is an R package for making regression coefficients more accessible. With this tool, you can read linear and logistic coefficients accurately and instantly, and more things are coming!

In the realm of statistical analyses, interpreting regression coefficients remains a cumbersome and often error-prone task. Historically, one might rely on direct assistance from a professor or specialist, a clear example of gatekeeping for a task that can be automated. Addressing this barrier, the Coeffeasy package emerges as a game changer within the R ecosystem, streamlining and automating the reading process. Originally tailored for linear and logistic models, Coeffeasy has set its sights on soon integrating more intricate models such as Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Time Series, and Experimental calculations like difference in means. Additionally, Coeffeasy offers multilingual support. Recognizing that the core of statistical interpretation remains unchanged across languages, the package endeavors to offer outputs in multiple languages, ensuring comprehensive and meaningful interpretations for a global audience. As the role of data continues to expand in our world, Coeffeasy leads the way in making intricate statistical insights clear, concise, and universally accessible, emphasizing the vital interplay of automation and accessibility in data science.
