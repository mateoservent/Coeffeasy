`Coeffeasy` is an R package under development for making regression
coefficients more accessible. With this tool, you can read linear,
logistic, and multinomial regression coefficients accurately and
instantly. The package now automatically controls for heteroscedasticity
and offers the capability to choose the type of standard error for the
correction and group errors by clusterâ€”all in a single, streamlined
function, and more enhancements are coming!

In the evolving landscape of statistical tools within the R environment,
`Coeffeasy` is an innovative R package designed to simplify and automate
the interpretation of regression coefficients. Historically,
statistics-related practitioners often sought expertise from specialists
to navigate the intricacies of regression results, recognizing that
although an interpretation of coefficients should follow a consistent
design, the underlying knowledge to read the results of a regression can
be quite technical and unambiguous in its presentation. Recognizing this
challenge, `Coeffeasy` offers a systematic solution, primarily serving
linear and logistic models. However, its developmental trajectory is set
to incorporate advanced models such as Regression Discontinuity Design
(RDD), Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Time Series data, and
Experimental calculations like difference in means. A standout feature
is its multilingual output capability, ensuring that the fundamental
principles of statistical interpretation are comprehensible to a
diverse, global user base. As data-driven decision-making continues to
gain prominence, `Coeffeasy` aims to bridge the knowledge gap, providing
clear and accessible statistical insights, reinforcing the importance of
both automation and accessibility in contemporary data science.

## Installation

Coeffeasy can be installed using the development version of the package
from [github](https://github.com/your_github_username/Coeffeasy) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mateoservent/Coeffeasy")
```

## Example Linear Regression

In this example, we use `Coeffeasy_lm()` to interpret coefficients from
a linear regression on the mtcars dataset, analyzing how car weight
affects miles per gallon when controlling for horsepower and quarter
mile time.

``` r
library(Coeffeasy)

# Fit the linear regression model
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + qsec, data = mtcars)

# Use Coeffeasy's function to interpret the coefficients

# Using the default settings, which automatically deduce variable names and use an alpha of 0.05
Coeffeasy_lm(model) 

# Specifying the names of the response and predictor variables for a clearer interpretation, and adjusting the significance level
Coeffeasy_lm(model, y = "Miles per gallon", x = "Car weight (1000 lbs)", alpha = 0.01) 
```

## Example Logistic Regression

Second example, we use `Coeffeasy_logit()` to interpret coefficients
from a logistic regression on the same dataset. We will analyze how the
weight of the car affects the likelihood of a car having an automatic
transmission (1 = Automatic; 0 = Manual).

``` r
# Fit the logistic regression model
model_logit <- glm(am ~ wt, data = mtcars, family = "binomial")

# Using the default settings, which automatically deduce variable names and use an alpha of 0.05
Coeffeasy_logit(model_logit) 

# Specifying the names of the response and predictor variables for a clearer interpretation, and adjusting the significance level
Coeffeasy_logit(model_logit, y = "Automatic Transmission", x = "Car weight (1000 lbs)", alpha = 0.01) 
```
